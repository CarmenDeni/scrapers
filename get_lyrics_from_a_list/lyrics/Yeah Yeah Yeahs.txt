**Spitting Off the Edge of the World**
Cowards, here's the sun
So bow your heads
In the absence of bombs
Draw your breath

Dark, dark places shall be none
She's melting houses of gold
And the kids cry out

We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
Spitting off the edge of the world
Out comes the sun
Never had no chance
Nowhere to run

Mama, what have you done?
I trace your steps
In the darkness of one
Am I what's left?
Silver lines whisper to me
Wounded arms must carry the load
And the kids cry out

Spitting off the edge of the world
Winds from the sky
Never had no chance
Will watch us riseEmbed

**Cheated Hearts**
Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up, up, up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one
Now, take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away

Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And she's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And he's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And we're

**Down Boy**
No fame, all there is
All there was on the second lady
Can't take a cent, take a cut
Of that kind of ran
I'll stand, kind of pushed
Kind of bent on this heavy land
I'll stand for the sake of my friend
I will see him there

Down, down
Count me down, down
Down boy, down
Count me down
Down boy, down boy
Down boy, down
The same not begin
Not give up in a better way
Again, washed the stain off his bed
Not to split him up

**Poor Song**Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things but
I ain't scared of loving you
And baby I know you're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love, cause
People will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too
But that don't mean your loving days are through
Cause people will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I may be just a fool
But I know you're just as cool
And cool kids, they belong togetherYou might also like1Embed
