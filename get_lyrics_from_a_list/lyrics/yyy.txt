**Down Boy **
No fame, all there is
All there was on the second lady
Can't take a cent, take a cut
Of that kind of ran
I'll stand, kind of pushed
Kind of bent on this heavy land
I'll stand for the sake of my friend
I will see him there

Down, down
Count me down, down
Down boy, down
Count me down
Down boy, down boy
Down boy, down
The same not begin
Not give up in a better way
Again, washed the stain off his bed
Not to split him up
I'll stand for the sake of my friend
I will see him there
Well, I will see him there

I hear it in my head real low

Turn into
The only thing I ever
Turn into
Hope I do

Well, I know that girl you found
Keeps that kind of window closed

She'll turn into
The only thing you ever

Can't say why I kept this from you
My, those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us, oh

**Poor Song **Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things but
I ain't scared of loving you
And baby I know you're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love, cause
People will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too
But that don't mean your loving days are through
Cause people will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I may be just a fool
But I know you're just as cool
And cool kids, they belong togetherYou might also like1Embed
